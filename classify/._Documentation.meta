Classifier System
-----------------

The Classifier System allows an operator to flexibly define groups of
*test*/*action* sequences to perform on a Machine.  These can be used
to do any number of tasks.

By default the classifier ships with a limited set of tests and actions
that can be performed.  However, the operator can specify additional
groups of test/actions pairs by use of the ``classify/custom-functions``
Param.  See the Param documentation on how to use it.

By default, the classifier is designed to exit on the first test match
that succeeds with a "pass" status.  The operator can override this
behavior by setting the optional ``continue`` value set to ``true``
in the ``classify/classification-data`` structure.

If you are extending the Classifier to add custom groups of *test*/*action*
sequences, please review the ``function ... {}`` BASH functions in the
``classify.sh.tmpl`` template.
