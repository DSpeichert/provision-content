Edge Lab Reference Environment
==============================

Assumptions:
* the leader node have internet access for downloading `containerd` and `k3s` binaries
* all nodes have have internet access for downloading containers
* `drpcli` has been installed on client system

Edge Lab requires Digital Rebar Platform tip (post v4.2) due to RPi install requirements.

Building & Installing DRP on Edge Lab
-------------------------------------

Please see the documentation in https://github.com/digitalrebar/edgelab for building the physical environment.

Setup Edge Lab Content
----------------------

Note: make sure that you `export RS_ENDPOINT` to your endpoint!

Edge Lab (edge-lab) is available in the RackN Catalog, you 
can install it using `drpcli catalog item install edge-lab`

To manually create and upload:

1. clone edge-lab with DRP content: `git clone https://github.com/digitalrebar/provision-content`
1. got to the edge-lab content: `cd provision-content\edge-lab`
1. build the content pack: `drpcli contents bundle edge-lab.yaml`
1. install the `edge-lab` content pack: `drpcli contents upload edge-lab.yaml`

If you make changes, you can repeat steps 3 and 4 to upload the latest content.

Setup K3s Cluster
-----------------

Before starting, install `kubectl` has been installed on client system

To build your cluster:
1. select the nodes for installation and apply the `k3s-install` workflow
1. wait for workflow to complete on leader
1. use `drpcli profiles get cluster01 param k3s/admin-conf --decode > admin.conf`

To access on the DRP server or cluster:
1. test with `kubectl --kubeconfig=admin.conf get nodes`

To access from another system, use an SSH tunnel:
1. setup an ssh tunnel: `ssh root@[host wifi ip] -L 6443:[leader node ip]:6443`
1. modify your `admin.conf` file to use `127.0.0.1` instead of the leader node ip
1. test with `kubectl --kubeconfig=admin.conf get nodes`
