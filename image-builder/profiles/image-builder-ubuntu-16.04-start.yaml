Name: builder-ubuntu-16.04-start
Description: Profile for image builder change-stage/map which uses 'builder-start' Stage.
Documentation: |
  NOTE:  This needs to be converted to Workflows - do not use
  the change-stage/map process.

  This change-stage/map will enable use of the Image Builder.
  Starting from a 'sledgehammer-wait' stage, place the machine
  in the 'builder-start' Stage.  The Machine will reboot and
  begin the Ubuntu install and Image Builder process.

  NOTE - Watch the Runner status, if it is not Active when
  the Ubuntu install starts, you need to Enable the Runner
  for the build to finish!!!
