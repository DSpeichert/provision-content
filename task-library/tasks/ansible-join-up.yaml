  Runs an embedded Ansible Playbook to run the DRP join-up process.

  Requires an `ansible` context.

  Expects to be in a Workflow that allows the joined machine to continue 
  Discovery and configuration steps as needed.

  Expects to have `rsa-key-create` run before stage is called and
  the public key MUST be on the target machine.
