  Discover including firewalld, run as a service and complete-nobootenv

  This workflow is recommended for joining cloud machines instead of `discover-base`.

  These added stages help for existing machines that may already
  have basic configuration (like firewalld) and a stable operating
  system (runner-service allows reboots).

  Complete-nobootenv ensures that Digital Rebar does not force
  the workflow into a bootenv (potentially rebooting) when finished.
Stages:
  - "discover-nobootenv"
  - "network-firewall"
  - "runner-service"
  - "complete-nobootenv"
